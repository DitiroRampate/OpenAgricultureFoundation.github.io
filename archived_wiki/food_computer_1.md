## Personal Food Computer 1.0

The first open source Personal Food Computer. This tabletop-sized unit
is being built all over the world by makers, hobbyists and schools that
are interested in learning and teaching about food production. These
small-scale environments are great for experimentation and for learning
about biology, botany, environment, programming, engineering, and more.
