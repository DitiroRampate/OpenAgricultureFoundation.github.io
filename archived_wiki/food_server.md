## Food Server

The OpenAgâ„¢ Food Server is a shipping container-sized, controlled
environment agriculture technology that can be built to utilize
hydroponic or aeroponic technology. It is intended to produce larger
quantities of food than a Personal Food Computer and will appeal to
interdisciplinary researchers and small-scale cafeterias, restaurants,
and boutique operators.

Food Server v1.0 was a transparent 40'x'10'x8' unit that was designed,
built and used for research by the Open Agriculture Initiative at the
MIT Media Lab from 2015-2017.

Food Server v2.0 is a more tightly-controlled shipping container unit
being designed, built, and used in research by the Open Agriculture
Initiative at its second research facility on the MIT Bates LINAC campus
beginning 2017.
