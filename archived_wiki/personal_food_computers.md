## Personal Food Computers
The OpenAg™ Personal Food Computer is a tabletop-sized, controlled environment agriculture technology platform that 
uses robotic systems to control and monitor climate, energy, and plant growth inside of a specialized growing chamber. 
Climate variables such as carbon dioxide, air temperature, humidity, dissolved oxygen, potential hydrogen, electrical 
conductivity, and root-zone temperature are among the many conditions that can be controlled and monitored within the 
growing chamber to yield various phenotypic expressions in the plants.

This unit is intended for experimental, educational, and personal use. It can be made from easily accessible 
components, expandable systems, and a standardized platforms on which to hack, modify, share, and upgrade over time. 
Build instructions and schematics for the OpenAg™ Personal Food Computer are open source, so anyone around the world 
can utilize this design.
