# Farming for the Future
OpenAg is an open-source community building an ecosystem of food technologies to create healthier, 
more engaging and more inventive food systems. You are welcome to edit most pages on this site, or better yet, 
create new pages of your own!

We're on a mission to create more farmers for the future of food production. We are developing the open source 
hardware and software platforms for sensor-controlled hydroponic and aeroponic agriculture systems. You can contribute!

“Food Computers,” as we call them, refer to the controlled environment agriculture devices that the OpenAg community 
develops. It's a type of device, like a PC or a 3D Printer. Currently, there are three scales of Food Computers - 
Personal Food Computers, Food Servers, and Food Data Centers - that can serve as tools for users to experiment, 
innovate, hack, and grow. Every time users grow and harvest, they will contribute to a library of [Climate Recipes](recipe.md) 
that can be borrowed and scaled so that users around the world can gain access to the best and freshest foods.

## Food Computer Plans

* Food Data Center*

Additional code, software and hardware plans can be found on [github.com/OpenAgricultureFoundation](github.com/OpenAgricultureFoundation).

*Note: plans for these scales are forthcoming, they are currently in development and are work in progress.
