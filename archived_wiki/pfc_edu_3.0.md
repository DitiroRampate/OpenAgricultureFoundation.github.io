## Personal Food Computer 3.0 (PFC_EDU)
The OpenAg™ Personal Food Computer 3.0 (PFC_EDU) is the latest evolution of the [Personal Food Computer](personal_food_computers.md).

The PFC 3.0 (PFC_EDU)The PFC_EDU was designed by the [MIT Open Agriculture Initiative (archive.org link)](https://web.archive.org/web/20190723192227/https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/open-agriculture-openag/overview/), in collaboration with the OpenAg 
community, especially educators working in both informal and formal education settings (e.g. libraries, schools, 
museums). It can be built, used, modified and hacked by the community for any number of applications. MIT continues 
to test its functionality, design, user interface and impact on learning with our education partners [i2 Learning](https://i2learning.org), 
the [Media Lab Learning Initiative](https://learn.media.mit.edu/), and educators and nerdfarmers of various ages, technical backgrounds, and access 
to resources.

Like any [Food Computer™](index.md), the PFC_EDU is a controlled environment agriculture technology platform that uses robotic 
systems to control and monitor climate, energy, and plant growth inside its specialized growing chamber. The PFC_EDU 
design has been scaled down from previous versions of the PFC in cost, size and complexity, and offers a spectrum of 
control so that users can make their growing experience as manual or as automated as they would like.

Design decisions for the PFC_EDU were based on cost, ease of manufacture, improved data validity, testing in schools, 
libraries, and museums, as well as feedback from the community. We involved an PFC_EDU Advisory Board comprised of 
folks from across the US, with a range of backgrounds and experience using novel STEM technology tools, to help us 
understand what design features were most engaging and useful for educators working with nerdfarmers between 8 and 14 
years old.

But the PFC_EDU isn't just for educators! Their insights and recommendations helped design a small, engaging, modular 
Food Computer that nerdfarmers with a broad spectrum of skills, resources, and interests can build and use, for a wide 
variety of scientifically rigorous, citizen-science experimentation.

### New Shape
Its “3U” form factor (30cm3 / 12in3) is comparable to [NASA's Veggie Production System](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/383.html), and compatible with the 
[Growing Beyond Earth Challenge STEM Education Program](https://informal.jpl.nasa.gov/museum/CP4SMP/growing-beyond-earth-challenge-stem-education-program).

### New Brain & Central Nervous System
Internally it runs our embedded software (the OpenAg Brain) on a robust [Beaglebone black wireless (BBB)](https://beagleboard.org/black-wireless) and the 
custom Central Nervous System (CNS) circuit board reads sensor data and controls LEDs to create, edit or maintain 
the [Climate Recipe](recipe.md) running inside. Nerdfarmers have the option of adding more advanced sensors and peripherals 
(pH, EC, DO, water temperature, and a USB camera) to the baseline CNS, as their skill level and resources allow.

### New Interfaces & Cloud Backend
There are a new set of cloud services (the OpenAg Cloud) that support the backend of the PFC_EDU, and connect it to 
the [Open Phenome (archive.org link)](https://web.archive.org/web/20190720114223/https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/open-phenome-project/overview/) (OpenAg's open source, digital library of Food Computer data and Climate Recipes).

The PFC_EDU also has a new web-based, front-end interface as well as a new device UI, for advanced networking, 
remote troubleshooting and monitoring. As of Fall 2018, both are still in development and testing with libraries 
and schools in a pilot test in the Boston area. You can get a sneak peak at both by taking a look at the 
Configuration Guide, below.
