Personal Food Computer 2.0
==========================

Please see [the personal food computers](personal_food_computers.md) page
for the latest release.

The [OpenAgâ„¢](/index.md) Personal Food Computer v2.0 was an evolution of
the [Personal Food Computer 1.0](/food_computer_1). The goal of the 2.0
was to refine and improve the design in a few key ways:

-   Add closed feedback loops to the environment.
-   Support for multiple recipe formats, including feedback-loop recipes
    that are able to measure and adapt in real time.
-   Pluggable, modular hardware and software. We want to make the Food
    Computer easier to hack, mod and improve upon.
-   Cheaper and easier to manufacture.
