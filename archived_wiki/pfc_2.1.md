## Personal Food Computer 2.1

**\*Update 11 October 2018**: Please note
that the OpenAg Project paused research on these versions.

The OpenAgâ„¢ Personal Food Computer v2.1 is an evolution of
the [PFC v2.0](food_computer_2.md). This release includes a new light
panel and updated software.

The updated software is the latest release of the [openag_brain
v1.0.0](https://github.com/OpenAgricultureFoundation/openag_brain/releases). It
has several updates and many bug fixes.

For more details on testing done with the v2.1 updates, check out
[Reliability Test Grow log](/contributors/test_grows/basil_1.md) with
notes, problems, pictures and results.

Note:// The v2.1 LED light panel was custom-made by Tim (one of our
awesome OpenAg engineers) and uses red/white/blue [GE
LED's](http://www.gelighting.com/LightingWeb/na/solutions/sign-lighting/tetra-powermax.jsp).
Some users have hacked their PFC's to use an [off-the-shelf grow
light](http://forum.openag.media.mit.edu/t/minimalist-growing/1635/5)
panel. OpenAg is working on finding a light and supplier that fit system
requirements and can be purchased online as a single unit.//
