## Database

Data on the [Food Computer 2.0](/archived_wiki/food_computer_2.md) is stored in
[CouchDB](http://couchdb.com/).

  - [CouchDB documentation](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.0.0/).

While the Food Computer is running, you can access the database in your
browser, using the Food Computer's IP address:

    http://<food computer IP>:5984/_utils/

This will open up [CouchDB's "Futon"
interface](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/1.6.1/intro/futon.html), a GUI for
editing the DB.

### API

You can also interact with the database via its API. See [openag\_brain
API](api.md) for more.

### Databases

  - **environment**: stores environment IDs. Usually there is only one.
  - **environmental\_data\_point**: stores datapoints generated by
    [Climate Recipes](/archived_wiki/recipe/index.md).
  - **recipes**: stores [Climate Recipes](/archived_wiki/recipe/index.md)
