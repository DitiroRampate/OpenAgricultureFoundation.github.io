### MVP Electrical Panel

##### Material:

  - Cardboard
  - Duct tape
  - 4 inch cable ties

##### Tools:

  - Small screw driver
  - Side cutter pliers

**WARNING**: unplug the Pi and all wires to avoid shorting the board or
electrocution. The electrical panel secures the Raspberry Pi, relay and
wiring to prevent wires from pulling loose or becoming detached.
**NOTE**: The goal of the MVP is minimal tools and expense. The
electrical panel is something that with a saw and drill could be made
much better, using a piece of Masonite or 1/8 inch hobby plywood. If you
have the material and tools, feel free to substitute.

1.  Cut two 12x8 inch pieces of cardboard (from the Amazon shipping
    box?).
2.  Duct tape them together around the edges and cover the back side
    with duct tape. The function of the duct tape on the back is to help
    keep the cable ties from pulling through the cardboard.

1.  Place the Pi, relay and 110v power cord on the panel, and with a
    pencil, mark the location of the mounting holes in the Pi and relay
    boards; then about Â¼ inch out mark a second spot for the cable tie
    (two holes are needed per tie). Then mark one hole on each side of
    the 110v extension cord; one set on the bottom, one set around the
    loop, and a third set at the top.

1.  Using the small screwdriver (or an awl or nail), carefully punch
    holes through the panel, to thread the cable-ties through.
2.  hread the cable ties through the holes, and tighten them to the
    boards and wires. I found that a 4 inch tie was not long enough for
    the wire loop, and used a second tie to increase the length.

1.  Using the side cutters, cut off the excess of the cable ties.
