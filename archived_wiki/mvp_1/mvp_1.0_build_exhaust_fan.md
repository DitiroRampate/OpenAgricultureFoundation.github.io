### MVP 1.0 Exhaust Fan Assembly

##### Material:

  - Relay board
  - Fan
  - Jumper wire (with ends clipped off and stripped)
  - Screw plug

**NOTE**: The fans I have, have three wires. The middle wire is voltage,
and the ground is on the outside (right facing the plug).

1.  Clip the ends of a jumper wire and strip the plastic coating off,
    exposing 3/8 inch of the wire.
2.  Unscrew the middle (second) terminal of relay 1, insert one end of
    the jumper wire, and tighten the terminal screw back down.
3.  Unscrew the power side of the plug, insert the other end of the
    jumper wire, and tighten.
4.  Clip the plugs from the fan.
5.  Unscrew the right ( 3rd) terminal of relay 1, insert the jumper
    wire, and tighten the terminal screw back down.
6.  Test the fan: plug in a 12v transformer into the plug. Since the 3rd
    terminal of the relay is the ‘LOW ON’ terminal, the fan should come
    on even if there is no power to the Raspberry and relay.

##### Installation on Box

1.  On the left side of the box, place the fan 4 inches from the top and
    centered.
2.  Draw around the outline of the fan.
3.  Draw a circle within the fan outline, matching the fan blade
    opening.
4.  Using a small screwdriver (or awl, nail or piece of wire); run it
    through the fan screw holes and mark their position on the box.
    Remove the fan and punch these holes through, being careful your
    hand is not on the inside of the box where the screwdriver will come
    through.
5.  Cover the inside holes with duct tape and re-punch them. The duct
    tape prevents the cable ties from pulling through (covered in a
    future step)
6.  Cut out the circle and line the edges with duct tape. Make sure the
    circle is big enough, and the duct tape is smoothed down; or else
    the sound of duct tape hitting against the fan blades will drive you
    crazy after a while.

1.  From the inside, insert 4 - 8 inch cable ties into the holes and
    push them all the way through to the outside.

1.  Place the fan over the opening, with the cable ties running through
    the screw mounting holes.
2.  Take 4 more 8 inch cable ties and push them over the cable ties
    coming through the fan to secure it in place.
