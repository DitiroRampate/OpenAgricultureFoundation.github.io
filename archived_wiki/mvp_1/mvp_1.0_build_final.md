### MVP 1.0 Final Assembly

#### Electrical Panel

Attach the panel to the left side of the box with two cable ties.

**NOTE**: Duct tape is not strong enough to hold the panel in place for
very long.

1.  Place the electrical panel on the left side, centered and about 4
    inches up from the bottom.
2.  Punch a hole with the screwdriver through the top corners of the
    panel and through the box wall.
3.  Place a 1 inch square pieces of duct tape over the holes on the
    inside of the box. Re-punch the hole through the duct tape.
4.  Run an 8 inch cable tie through the inside of the box and through
    the panel.
5.  Use two more cable tie (slid onto the first) to compress the panel
    to the side of the box.

#### Light Connection

1.  Screw the bulbs into the sockets. You may be using two or four
    bulbs.
2.  Take one of the power strips and put it on the top of the box
3.  Plug in all the sockets that have bulbs
4.  Plug the power strip into the extension cord attached to the relay
5.  Plug the extension cord into a wall outlet
6.  **NOTE** If wired correctly, the relay should be 'open' so that the
    lights should turn on.

#### Always-on Power

1.  Take the other power strip and set it beside the left side of the
    box, near the electrical panel
2.  Plug in two 12V transformers
3.  Plug in a USB 'wall wart', and plug a micro USB cable into the wart.
4.  Plug one transformer into the fan plug connected to the relay
5.  Plug the other transformer into the circulation fan
6.  Plug the power strip into a wall outlet
7.  **NOTE**: The circulation fan should be running, as well as the
    exhaust fan.
8.  **NOTE**: The Raspberry Pi should have been previously tested with
    the software installed, and have the SD card in place so it will
    boot when powered up.
9.  Plug the USB cable into the Raspberry Pi (if you are connecting a
    screen, mouse and keyboard to the Raspberry Pi, do this before
    connecting the power).
