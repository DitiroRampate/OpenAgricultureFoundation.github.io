### MVP 1.0 Lights Assembly

##### Materials

  - GE Bright Stiks
  - Pendant light fixtures

##### Tools

  - Utility Knife

The goal is to cut four openings in the top of the box. Creating an
access hole in the outer layer of cardboard, and making a small access
flap in the bottom layer. There is a small slit in the side of this flap
that provides a 'friction fit' to hold the lamp wire.

1.  Draw diagonal lines between the corners of the top of the box.
2.  Measure 8 inches in from each corner, and mark this location. This
    is where the lamps will eventually hang.
3.  Measure back (toward the corner) from each mark, and draw a 2 inch
    box.

1.  On just the outside layer of cardboard, cut out these four squares,
    and cut a slit along the diagonal, from the square to the mark.
2.  On the inside layer, a 1/2 inch back from the mark (1/4 inch in from
    the top square, draw a 1 inch square.
3.  You will now cut a squared off "Y" shape, or something that looks
    like an American football goal post. The base is the line from the
    mark to the square. This is where the electrical cord will be
    located. The arms of the "Y" will form a flap through which you can
    insert the plug of the lamp fixture.

1.  Insert the plug through the flap, pulling it all the way through
    till the bulb holder is next to the top of the box.

1.  Close the flap, and put a piece of duct tape over the flap to keep
    it closed.
2.  Repeat this for all four marks.
