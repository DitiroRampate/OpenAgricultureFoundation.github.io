### Cardboard Box Enclosure

The housing is a 24x18x18 heavy duty cardboard box with the inside
coated with silver mylar. These plans include the optional window and
door.

##### Tools:

  - Utility Knife
  - Pencil
  - Ruler
  - Scissors

##### Materials:

  - 24x18x18 heavy duty box
  - Duct tape
  - Plastic sheet (window – optional)
  - Mylar

<!-- end list -->

1.  Disassemble the box: Find the edge where it has been glued together
    and carefully separate the box along the glue seam. It may be
    easiest to do this by running a ruler or other thin object between
    the layers.

4.  Glue the mylar: 

**WARNING**: Work in a well ventilated area, preferably outdoors but not
in the sun (the mylar is very reflective\!\!). Work on a surface that
will not be hurt by the adhesive overspray (it is difficult to remove
and remains sticky for a long time).

1.  Determine the best positioning of the mylar (do this before applying
    adhesive). This will vary depending on the size of sheets or if you
    have a roll. My mylar came as 20x24 inch sheets. This worked best
    when the sheets were ‘horrizontal’ across on the 24 inch sides, and
    ‘vertical’ on the 18 inch sides. Allow about a ½ inch overlap
    between sheets.
2.  Working one ‘pannel’ at a time, spray the adhesive on that section
    of the box. Spray in a sweeping motion, being sure to have adhesive
    along the edges.
3.  ![](/static/images/wiki/mvp/img_20170628_142821.jpg)
4.  Working with another person, hold the sheets of mylar by the
    corners. One person positions and presses down the mylar, while the
    other person holds the rest of the sheet an inch or two off of the
    surface. Start by holding the sheet over the bottom portion of a
    section, aligning the bottom edges. With a light tension, lower the
    bottom corners onto the bottom edge of the cardboard, sticking the
    corners. With a free hand (or a third helper) slowly start smoothing
    the mylar down on the adhesive, smoothing the sheet from the bottom
    edge toward the top. If you place a sheet the wrong direction and
    have a ‘gap’, place an extra sheet over the gap and cut away the
    excess, leaving about a ½ inch overlap. Do not concern yourself with
    gluing down the overlapping edges. It is easiest to work on one
    panel surface at a time.

6.  Fold the smaller end flaps in.
7.  Close the side flaps and seal the box. Place one strip of tape from
    about 6 inches down from the top, and bring the tape up over the
    top, along the flap seam, extend the tape down the other side about
    6 inches. Then run a piece of tape along both sides, sealing up the
    flaps

9.  Leave the bottom flaps open, and tape the edges together. This makes
    the box 27 inches tall.

##### Window (optional)

1.  On the front of the box (wide side with the glue edge on the left),
    measure up 2 inches from the fold between the bottom flap and the
    box side panel, and 12 inches from the side (centered between the
    sides) and make a mark.
2.  Place the plastic sheet on the box with the wide edge centered below
    your mark. Draw around the plastic.
3.  Lift off the plastic and draw a rectangle, 1/2 inch inside the
    window outline.

6.  With the utility knife, carefully cut out the inner rectangle (you
    will use this for a shutter).
7.  ![](/static/images/wiki/mvp/img_20170628_150342.jpg)
8.  Line the cut edge of the window with duct tape. Take a strip of tape
    about the length of an edge, hold it about 1/2 inch over the inside
    and press it against the mylar. Fold it over the edge of the window
    and seal it against the outside of the box. Repeat this for all four
    sides of the window. This will hold the mylar in place, and cut down
    moisture getting into the cardboard.
9.  Lay the plastic over the outer pencil rectangle and tape it down,
    overlapping the plastic by about 1/2 inch.
10. ![](/static/images/wiki/mvp/img_20170628_150923.jpg)
11. With the piece of cardboard you cut out, on the mylar side, place a
    piece of duct tape about 1/2 inch down, leaving the rest sticking
    up. Turn the cardboard over and place another piece of duct tape
    along the top edge, carefully folding it down the edge of the
    cardboard and onto the first piece of tape. Take a third piece of
    tape, about 4 inches longer that the width of the shutter, and place
    it on the duct tape, just above the cardboard. Use this last piece
    of tape to secure the shutter to the box, lining the shutter to
    cover the window.

**NOTE**: Putting a piece of tape on the outside of the shutter and
attaching it directly to the box will cause the shutter to hang
partially open, it needs to hang from the side of the cardboard closest
to the box. ![](/static/images/wiki/mvp/img_20170628_164609.jpg) ![](/static/images/wiki/mvp/img_20170628_151018.jpg)

##### Door

1.  4 inches down from the top, on the front; cut from the glue flap (on
    the left) to the right side.
2.  At the bottom of the glue flap, along the crease for the bottom
    flaps, cut from the left to the right.
3.  Wrap the top and bottom edges of the door with duct tape. Start with
    ½ inch on the inside and wrap around to the outside.
4.  Tighten up the flaps. Punch a hole from the inside through the side
    flap and the top flap two inches back from the edge. Insert an 8
    inch cable tie from the inside and pull through. Thread another
    cable tie onto this one and push it down till the flaps are tight.
    Repeat for the other side flap.
5.  For a simple latch, tape a rectangle of cardboard on the left side,
    with the top being in line with the bottom edge of the door opening.
    Let it stick out the front about an inch, and rest the door on this
    when you close it. **Note**: Duct tape is not strong enough to take
    the pressure on the latch, either glue the latch to the box, or use
    cable ties.
