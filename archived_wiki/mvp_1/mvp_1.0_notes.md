### MVP 1.0 Notes

  - Duct tape tends to come loose after a build. A day or two after
    assembling the enclosure; go back over things and press the tape
    down.
  - Long term the left side of the door opening may be a weak spot that
    could have a tendency to collapse. Now, or at some future time,
    consider taping/gluing a small wooden rod to the edge of the opening
    to strengthen it.
  - If you added the wooden rod, you will have a flat spot on the left
    edge of the door, this is a good place to put a piece of sticky
    magnetic strip (and one on the flap of the door) for a nice latch.

Happy Growing \!\!\!
