## Food Data Center

The OpenAgâ„¢ Food Data Center will be the industrial-scale version of the
Food Computer. These warehouse-sized units may one day serve as
large-scale farms to supply the masses. Compared to traditional farming,
Food Data Centers would require less land and water, and would allow
farmers to grow food in places like cities, deserts, or disaster zones
where plants could otherwise not be grown. These units would allow
growing to become hyper-localized, eliminating the need to transport
crops across the globe. This could allow for more sustainable, fresher,
and better-quality food to be grown locally, anywhere.
