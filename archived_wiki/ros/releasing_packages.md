## Releasing ROS Packages

[ROS](../ros.md) has a tool for releasing catkin packages
called [Bloom](http://wiki.ros.org/bloom).

### Build farm, CI

[ROS Build Farm](http://wiki.ros.org/buildfarm) can be used for nightly
builds and CI testing. It is based on Jenkins.

  - There is a hosted instance for open source packages at
    <http://build.ros.org/>
  - The ROS build farm is also designed to enable deploying a custom
    build farm. This can be useful to release closed-source packages
