## Arugula recipe

Peter K. says this is an easier, hearty plant to grow for testing the
PFC.

### Germination

  - [Generic germination
    procedure](../contributors/recipes/generic_germination.md).
  - Assume the seedlings we transplant to the PFC are two weeks old.

### Description

  - Seed: Go to Johnny's Seeds online and order a packet of plain old,
    [regular
    arugula](http://www.johnnyseeds.com/vegetables/greens/arugula-roquette/arugula-seed-385.html).
      - Regular arugula germinates from seed in 5-7 days and is fully
        mature in 40 days.
      - This is yummy: [wasabi
        arugula](http://www.johnnyseeds.com/vegetables/greens/arugula-roquette/wasabi-arugula-seed-3865.html)
        (5-7 days germination, 45 days to maturity).
  - Temperature: 
      - Arugula does not require as much warmth as basil. Eventually,
        we'll tweak night temp down to maximize quality but for now
        let's go with maximum growth as we learn how to grow in the PFC.
      - Day: 21.1째C == 70째F
      - Night: 15.6째C == 60째F
  - Humidity: 60 (40 \~ 70% RH)
  - Photo-period: 16 hours
  - PAR: 300
      - Arugula is still in the leafy greens category, if my 300 umole
        recommendation has resulted in the tight basil response you
        could try the 250.
      - Spectrum: basic 80/20 red/blue, can work in some white if you
        want to provide some other wavelengths
  - pH: 6. range is 5.4 - 6.2
  - Nutrients: 150 ppm nitrogen from our A/B combo, arugula could go a
    bit higher at 200 ppm nitrogen. 
      - Later we can dial in. Sometimes nutrition can be iffy if other
        growth factors are off and starting out a bit lighter is better
        than too strong while other growth parameters are being dialed
        in.
  - EC: Dose consistently per instructions from bottle
  - CO2: Ambient OK / 1,200 \~ 1,500 with doping
