## Generic germination procedure

  - Photoperiod: 16hr
  - Ideal PAR: 250-350 ¬µmol/m2.
      - Seeds and seedlings aren‚Äôt photosynthesizing yet. Light at this
        stage is serving as a signal to break dormancy and point the
        plant to what‚Äôs ‚Äúup.‚Äù So long as there is ‚Äúsome‚Äù light to
        provide that signal, germination should be successful. 
  - Distance between the light and the top of the foam cubes: 14‚Äù (where
    the PAR was measured)
  - Nutrients: 150 ppm nitrogen from our [standard A/B
    protocol](/archived_wiki/contributors/recipes/generic_nutrients.md).
  - Watering: wet cubes twice a day. The foam cubes naturally dry
    between cycles.
      - We use a flood and drain system, which keeps the cubes/seeds
        moist all day. See picture below. The idea is that twice a day,
        the cubes get flooded in water, keeping them moist until the
        next flood. 
  - Ideal temperature: 
      - Rack / tub is open to the ambient climate.
  - Ideal humidity: 
      - Rack / tub is open to the ambient climate.

## mini seedling germinator

At our large Bates facility, we need hundreds of seedlings at a time to
start a new experiment in the Food Servers. In our tiny lab on the MIT
campus / Media Lab building / OpenAg offices, we only need 12 seedlings
per PFC. So Rob Baynes built
this scaled down seedling germinator for his own use and provides these
"plans" for you as-is.

### design

The simple design is the small pump runs for one minute every 12 hours
and puts enough water+nutrients into the clear bin to wet the foam cubes
to the seed level. The fluid drains out via gravity back into a hole cut
into the bucket lid. There is a small stick that holds the fill corner
up a bit, so flow is down to the drain.

Adjust the pump flow rate and partially occlude the drain hole so the
fluid drains at a slightly slower rate than the pump.

The second timer turns the grow light on for 16 hours.

Any grow light will work, spectrum and power don't really matter. Just
the 'light' itself and some of the warmth are what triggers the the seed
to become active.

In the picture you may notice that we taped a bit of black plastic
inside the bin. That is to make sure the foam cubes are not sitting in
left over fluid that doesn't drain out.

### parts

  - [small 80 GPH aquarium
    pump](https://www.amazon.com/Homasy-Submersible-Aquarium-Fountain-Hydroponics/dp/B00EWENMAU/)
  - two 24 hour timers:
      - [digital timer with 1 minute minimum on time for the
        pump](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MVF16JG/)
      - [mechanical timer for a 16 hour photoperiod for the grow
        light](https://www.amazon.com/iPower-GLTIME-Heavy-Plug-Mechanical/dp/B00BDGHJK4/)
  - [5 gallon bucket with

  - [.5" clear hose](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VAY4SA/)
  - .5" fittings for fill and drain:
      - [bulkhead drain](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002Z7U1K/)
      - [bulkhead fill](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DVWOIA/)
        friction fit, but doesn't leak (yet) üòÉ (the fill 'filter' is
        useful to keep the fluid from squirting straight up onto the
        light when the pump first comes on)
  - clear plastic bin
  - any grow light
