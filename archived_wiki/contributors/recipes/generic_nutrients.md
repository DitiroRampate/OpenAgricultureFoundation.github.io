## Nutrient formula

How Peter makes his stock and final dilution of nutrients:

  - 100x (1:100) dilution *stock* which produces 100ppmN (parts per
    million of Nitrogen)
      - 5-12-26 (green)
      - 15-0-0 (blue)

<!-- end list -->

  - For Food Servers to grow ***leafy greens*** we want to use 150ppmN:
      - 100ppm 5-12-26 put 400ml stock in 10 gal.
      - 50ppm 15-0-0 put 200ml stock in 10 gal.

<!-- end list -->

  - For PFCs to grow ***leafy greens*** we want to use 150ppmN:
      - 100ppm 5-12-26 put 30 ml stock in 3 liters of water.
      - 50ppm 15-0-0 put 15 ml stock in 3 liters of water.
      - Both of the above solutions are put in the *same* 3 liter
        (large) water bottle for the PFC.

Math:

    1:100 = x:3000ml, x=30ml of 5-12-26 stock.
    1:200 = x:3000ml, x=15ml of 15-0-0 stock.

*Keep both solutions separate\!* or they will precipitate calcium and
make a mess. Once they are diluted to the final concentration, they can
safely be mixed.
