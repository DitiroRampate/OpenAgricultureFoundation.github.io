### Basil recipe for test grow \#1

#### Germination

  - [Generic germination
    procedure](/archived_wiki/contributors/recipes/generic_germination.md).
  - Assume the seedlings we transplant to the PFC are two weeks old.

#### Description

  - Temperature: 
      - Day: 23.89 \~ 26.66, use 25째C (75\~80 째F) (Variation due to no
        control of sun during day)
      - Night: 18.3째C (65 째F)
  - Humidity: 60 (40 \~ 70% RH)
  - Photo-period: 16 hours
  - pH: range is 5.7 \~ 6.3, using 6.
  - Nutrients: part A and part B (JR peters cocktail based on their
    dilution rates)
  - EC: Dose consistently per instructions from bottle
  - CO2: Ambient OK / 1,200 \~ 1,500 with doping

#### Unknowns

  - Do we need different settings for various growth stages or day
    ranges?
      - With Basil, main phases are germination and growth. No
        flowering, etc.
  - What is the expected time frame to grow to maturity? 
      - 2 week old seedlings to maturity is 3 to 4 weeks.

#### More detail

pH should be adjusted to be within range, and fluctuations usually
indicate the plants are absorbing the nutrients, causing a change in pH.
If the pH is outside the desired range, it can lead to some essential
nutrients not being absorbed the plant even if it is present in the
water. Some leading nutrients are Nitrogen and Calcium for this. Tip
burn and curled leaves can be caused by this.

The EC is a rough metric of nutrients, but we should just dose
consistently based on the dosage instructions for the bottle.

The RH is pretty flexible, but at high humidity, the plant will not be
able to create water vapor to exhale out the stomata, making it unable
to get new nutrient rich water from the roots. It can also cause fungi
and disease buildup.
